## Properties

### Resource: Start

#### Operation: Execute

| Field Name | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource | Hidden | Fixed resource type (always start) | Yes |
| Operation | Hidden | Fixed operation (always execute) | Yes |
| Notice | Notice | Informational message about workflow execution | No |

### Workflow Entry Point

This node serves as the entry point for manual workflow execution. When you click "Execute Workflow" in the n8n editor, execution begins from this node.

#### Key Features:
- **Manual Trigger**: Initiates workflow execution manually
- **No Input Required**: Does not require any input connections
- **Single Output**: Provides one output connection to start the workflow
- **Always First**: Should be placed at the beginning of workflows

#### Configuration Options:
| Field Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Notice | Notice | Informational message about workflow execution | No | - |

### Usage Guidelines

- Place this node at the beginning of workflows that need manual triggering
- Connect its output to the first processing node in your workflow
- No configuration is typically required beyond the default settings
- Use for testing workflows during development
- Suitable for workflows that should only run when manually triggered
