# ManualChatTrigger

## Overview

The ManualChatTrigger node serves as the entry point for chat-based workflow executions within n8n's LangChain ecosystem. This specialized trigger node enables interactive chat sessions where users can manually initiate workflow executions through a chat interface. It acts as the foundation for building conversational AI workflows, allowing real-time interaction between users and AI-powered automation systems.

## Credentials

This node does not require direct credentials as it operates within the n8n workflow context:

- **Workflow Access**: Standard n8n workflow execution permissions
- **Node Dependencies**: Inherits credentials from connected nodes when applicable
- **System Access**: Uses n8n's built-in security and access control mechanisms

## Inputs

The ManualChatTrigger node does not accept inputs as it serves as a workflow entry point:

- **No Direct Inputs**: Trigger nodes initiate workflows rather than receive data
- **Chat Interface**: User interaction occurs through the integrated chat interface
- **Manual Activation**: Workflows are triggered by user chat messages

## Outputs

The node outputs basic workflow initiation data:

- **Main Output**: Standard workflow data to trigger downstream nodes
- **Connection Type**: `NodeConnectionTypes.Main`
- **Output Data**: Empty JSON array `[{}]` to initiate workflow execution
- **Trigger Event**: Chat message reception triggers workflow execution
